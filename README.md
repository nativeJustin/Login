# Login

This is a project I created using Node.JS to create a secure User Authentication system. 

Things I learned During the project:

- How to use Password Salt.
- How to hash a password correctly.
- How to use Bcrypt. 
- User Login.
- How to store passwords.
- Express Server Setup.

Used REST Client to test the function of the code.
